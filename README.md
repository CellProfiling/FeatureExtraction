# FeatureExtraction
This code extracts SLF quantitative image features for fluorescent microscopy images. This code was a collaboration between Murphy lab (murphylab.web.cmu.edu) and the HPA Cell Atlas (proteinatlas.org/humancell). Explanations for SLF features can be found here (murphylab.web.cmu.edu/services/SLF/features.html).
