% Created as part of TACTICS v2.x Toolbox under BSD License
% TACTICS (Totally Automated Cell Tracking In Confinement Systems) is a Matlab toolbox for High Content Analysis (HCA) of fluorescence tagged proteins organization within tracked cells. It designed to provide a platform for analysis of Multi-Channel Single-Cell Tracking and High-Trough Output Quantification of Imaged lymphocytes in Microfabricated grids arrays.
% We wish to make TACTICS V2.x available, in executable form, free for academic research use distributed under BSD License.
% IN ADDITION, SINCE TACTICS USE THIRD OPEN-CODE LIBRARY (I.E TRACKING ALGORITHEMS, FILTERS, GUI TOOLS, ETC) APPLICABLE ACKNOLEDMENTS HAVE TO BE SAVED TO ITS AUTHORS.

% NOTES-
% Although TACTICS is free it does require Matlab commercial license.
% We do not expect co-authorship for any use of TACTICS. However, we would appreciate if TACTICS would be mentioned in the acknowledgments when it used for publications and/or including the next citation: [enter our Bioinformatics]
% We are looking for collaborations and wiling to setup new components customized by the requirements in exchange to co-authorship.
%  Support and feedbacks
% TACTICS is supported trough Matlab file exchange forums or contact us directly. Updates are expected regularly. We are happy to accept any suggestions to improve the automation capability and the quality of the analysis.
