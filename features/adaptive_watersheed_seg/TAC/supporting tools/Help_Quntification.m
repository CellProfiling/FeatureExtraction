% TACTICS (Totally Automated Cell Tracking In Confinement Systems) is a Matlab toolbox for High Content Analysis (HCA) of fluorescence tagged proteins organization within tracked cells. It designed to provide a platform for analysis of Multi-Channel Single-Cell Tracking and High-Trough Output Quantification of Imaged lymphocytes in Microfabricated grids arrays.

% Code starts here:
function varargout = Help_Quntification(varargin)

% HELP_QUNTIFICATION M-file for Help_Quntification.fig
%      HELP_QUNTIFICATION, by itself, creates a new HELP_QUNTIFICATION or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = HELP_QUNTIFICATION returns the handle to a new HELP_QUNTIFICATION or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      HELP_QUNTIFICATION('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in HELP_QUNTIFICATION.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      HELP_QUNTIFICATION('Property','Value',...) creates a new HELP_QUNTIFICATION or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before Help_Quntification_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to Help_Quntification_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
