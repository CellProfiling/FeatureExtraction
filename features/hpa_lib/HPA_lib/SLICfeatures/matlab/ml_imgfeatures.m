function [names, values, slfnames] = ml_imgfeatures(imageproc, dnaproc)

% [NAMES, VALUES, SLFNAMES] = ML_IMGFEATURES(IMAGEPROC, DNAPROC)
%
%    Calculates features for IMAGEPROC
%    where IMAGEPROC contains the pre-processed fluorescence image, 
%    and DNAPROC the pre-processed DNA fluorescence image.
%    Pre-processed means that the image has been cropped and had 
%    pixels of interest selected (via a threshold, for instance).
%    Use DNAPROC=[] to exclude features based on the DNA image.  
%
%    Features calculated include:
%      - Number of objects
%      - Euler number of the image (# of objects - # of holes)
%      - Average of the object sizes
%      - Variance of the object sizes
%      - Ratio of the largest object to the smallest
%      - Average of the object distances from the COF
%      - Variance of the object distances from the COF
%      - Ratio of the largest object distance to the smallest
%      - DNA: average of the object distances to the DNA COF
%      - DNA: variance of the object distances to the DNA COF
%      - DNA: ratio of the largest object distance to the smallest
%      - DNA/Image: distance of the DNA COF to the image COF
%      - DNA/Image: ratio of the DNA image area to the image area
%      - DNA/Image: fraction of image that overlaps with DNA
