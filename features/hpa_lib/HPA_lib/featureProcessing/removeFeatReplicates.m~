function [featuresunique,names_unique] = removeFeatReplicates(features,featnames)
%This function takes a feature matrix and returns only unique columns
%(feature values)
%
%INPUTS: 
%features - an nxm matrix where n is the number of observations (cells) and
%m is the number of features. 
%featnames - a 1xm cell array of feature names 
%
%OUTPUTS:
%featuresunique - an nx(m-r) matrix where r is the number of replicates
%removed from the feature matrix
%names_unique - a 1x(m-r) cell array of unique feature names

%There are two ways to find unique features,
%1. By feature value
%2. By feature name
%The advantage of type 1 is that you do not eliminate features with unique
%values. If values are not unique and the names are we will have to choose
%a name. 
%I will also check type 2 to make sure that features get unique names. If
%names are not unique and the values are then we will assign a new name to
%the duplicate name to ensure unique names 

%Convert to cell
featcell = num2cell(features',2);
featsstr = num2str(featsLIMS');
featcellstr = cellstr(featsstr);
%separate only names from feature sets 
[fsets,fnames] = strtok(featnames,':');
%append the feature names to cell array 
featvals_w_names=[char(featcellstr),char(fnames)];
[uniquefeats,ia,ic] = unique(s1,'rows');


%First get all the unique feature values. 
[ufeatvals,ia,ic] = unique(features','rows');

%Then sort them
[indsu,indsorig] = sort(ic);

%Then test where the sorted inds are equal
indsu2 = [indsu(2:end);NaN];
indsu3 = [NaN;indsu(1:end-1)];
repfeatsL = [indsu==indsu2];
repfeatsR = [indsu==indsu3];
repfeats = (repfeatsL+repfeatsR)>0;

indsreporig = indsorig(repfeats);

%get the names of the replicated features 
repnames = featnames(indsreporig);
%split the names into parts 
[repsetname,repnameonly] = strtok(repnames,':');

%because these are sorted, we should see that the names with the same
%values are next to each other
%figure out if the names are also matching 
featsleft = 1;
while featsleft>0
    
    %if both the feature value and name are the same, remove the feature 
    if all(features(:,indsreporig(i))==features(:,indsreporig(i+1)))
       if strcmpi(repnameonly(i),repnameonly(i+1))
           disp('Replicate features found, eliminating duplicates with the name ',repnameonly{i})
           fname2{i} = 
       end
        
    end
    
end
