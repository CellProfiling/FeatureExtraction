function splitFeatSets(features,featnames,outputdir,fsets)
%This function splits feature sets calculated in the production. 
%
%INPUTS: 
%features - an nxm matrix where n is the number of observations (cells) and
%m is the number of features. 
%featnames - a 1xm cell array of feature names 
%fsets - a 1xm cell array of the feature sets used in the current production
%pipeline.
